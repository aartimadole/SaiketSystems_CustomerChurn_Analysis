## 🧭 **Project Overview**

This project is part of my **Business Analysis Internship** at **Saiket Systems**, where I conducted a detailed **Customer Churn Analysis** using a real-world telecom dataset.  

The goal is to analyze customer behavior, identify patterns in churn, and provide actionable insights to improve customer retention strategies.

---

## 🎯 **Objectives**

- Understand and explore the structure of the **Telco Customer Churn Dataset**
- Perform **data cleaning and preprocessing**
- Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify churn trends
- Visualize **customer segmentation** by tenure and monthly charges
- Perform **advanced churn analysis** based on demographics, contract types, and payment methods
- Summarize **key insights** and business recommendations

---

## 🧰 **Tools & Technologies**

| Category | Tools |
|-----------|--------|
| Programming | Python |
| Libraries | pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn |
| Development | Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab |
| Visualization | Power BI (optional) |
| Dataset | Telco Customer Churn Dataset (CSV format) |

---

## 📂 **Dataset Description**

The dataset includes telecom customer information with fields such as:

| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| `customerID` | Unique customer identifier |
| `gender`, `SeniorCitizen`, `Partner`, `Dependents` | Demographics |
| `tenure`, `Contract`, `PaymentMethod` | Account details |
| `InternetService`, `OnlineSecurity`, `TechSupport`, `StreamingTV` | Services used |
| `MonthlyCharges`, `TotalCharges` | Billing information |
| `Churn` | Target variable (Yes/No) |

---

## 🧩 **Project Tasks**

| Task | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Task 1:** Understand the Dataset | Explore structure, column types, and missing values |
| **Task 2:** Data Cleaning | Remove duplicates, handle missing data, standardize formatting |
| **Task 3:** Exploratory Data Analysis | Summary statistics and churn visualization |
| **Task 4:** Customer Segmentation | Tenure-based segmentation and visualization |
| **Task 5:** Advanced Analysis | Churn analysis by demographics, contract, and payment type |

---

## 📊 **Key Insights**

- Customers with **shorter tenure (0–12 months)** are more likely to churn.  
- **Month-to-month contracts** show significantly higher churn rates.  
- Customers paying via **Electronic Check** churn more frequently.  
- **Long-term contracts** and **automatic payment methods** improve retention.  
- High **Monthly Charges** correlate with increased churn risk.

---

## 🏁 **Conclusion**

This project demonstrates the full business analysis process — from raw data understanding to actionable insights — using Python and data visualization tools.  
The findings can help telecom businesses **reduce churn** and **improve customer loyalty** through data-driven strategies.
